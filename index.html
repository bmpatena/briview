		<h1> Briview - Brian's Image, Surface and Graph Viewer</h1>
	    <p> This is an image and surface viewer that is aimed at neuroimaging applications. This is all implemented in C++/OpenGL/Qt. The software provides a lot of flexibility in rendering options. This project and documentation is in development.</p>
<p>
Some key features include:

Surface rendering of VTK/GIFTI formats.
Supports loading of NIFTI images in world coordinates and voxel coordinates.
Orthoview screen capture as well as a flexible video capture facilities.
Load and Saving of scenes (partially implemented).</p>
<p> Briview has also been extended to also include graoh visualization on the brain.</p>

		<h1> Usage </h1>
		    <p>./briview -im image -m surface</p>
		    <h3> NOtes </h3>
		    <p> Images are of NIFTI format. Surface </p>

		<h3>Surfaces, Image and Graphs</h3>
		<p>briview renders surfaces and images</p>
		<p>Briview supports GIFTI, VTK, PLY surface formats. The surface render parameters are higly customizable</p>
                <p>3D images are represented as 3 orthogonal cut planes</p>
